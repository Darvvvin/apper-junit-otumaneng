👉 Understanding JUnit Library

What is JUnit
* Most widely used unit testing library for Java
    - Provide tools to verify results from the code under test


Well first, what is UNIT TESTING?


===================================================================================================


UNIT TESTING is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are
tested.

The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected.

Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers.

Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness.

A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.

LEVELS of TESTING
> Unit Test         : per component
Integration Test    : test integrated components 
System Test         : checking system’s compliance as per the requirements.
Acceptance          : Acceptance testing is done by the user, customer, and/or stockholders
